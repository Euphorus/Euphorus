- 🌱 I’m currently learning Games Design and Programming

- 📫 How to reach me syuvraj.2021@gmail.com is my email address you can contact me there or k010885m@student.staffs.ac.uk if you want to contact me via my student email, because I don't have a social media. Trying not to get into instant gratification.
